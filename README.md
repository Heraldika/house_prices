# House price predictions

Data: [House Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)

This is a basic project where I use Linear regression and Random forrest regression to predict prices of houses.

To run the project yourself download the dataset, install dependencies from requirements.txt, uncomment code that creates the models and run the kernel.
